# 🧬 Behavior Evolution Game

A browser-based simulation designed to study how behavior evolves through genetic mutations affecting brain function.

🌐 **Live Demo**: [Play the Game](https://aminadav-ai.github.io/Behavior-Evolution-Game/)

---

## 🧠 Overview

This simulation explores how behavioral traits can emerge, adapt, and evolve over time as a result of genetic changes. Entities like **grass**, **sheep**, and **lions** interact within an environment that supports mutation, selection, and survival dynamics.

- 🌱 Grass grows automatically.
- 🐑 Sheep are added by the user and consume grass.
- 🦁 Lions hunt sheep, and both species can reproduce and mutate over generations.
- 👁 Entities have limited perception and act based on internal “genes”.
- 🧬 Over time, evolution drives smarter or more adaptive behaviors.

---

## 🕹 Features

- Add or remove animals dynamically.
- Step-by-step or continuous simulation modes.
- Visual indicators of what an animal "sees".
- View each entity’s:
  - Type
  - Energy
  - Offspring count
  - Age & generation
  - Sensory input
  - Genes (visualized)

---

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- HTML5 + CSS3
- Algorithmic logic based on **Genetic Algorithms**
- Visualization of simulated brain/gene function

---

## 🧑‍🔬 How to Use

1. Open the [live demo](https://aminadav-ai.github.io/Behavior-Evolution-Game/).
2. Click "New Sheep" or "New Lion" to populate the world.
3. Use “Step” to advance frame-by-frame or “Run” to simulate continuously.
4. Tap on any animal to inspect its behavior, sensory input, and internal state.
5. Observe how behavior evolves over time with genetic mutation.

## 🚧 Future Plans

- Save/load simulation state
- Add brain visualizer / heatmap
- Export data for research analysis
- Improve UI and controls
